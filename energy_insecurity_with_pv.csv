Notes:  Because of rounding, data may not sum to totals.  See RECS Terminology for the definitions of terms used in these tables.
a Total U.S. includes all primary occupied housing units in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Vacant housing units, seasonal units, second homes, military houses, and group quarters are excluded.
b Household energy insecurity as defined in this table includes only those issues collected as part of the RECS questionnaire. Other factors, such as energy costs as a percentage of household income, could be considered as household energy insecurity, but they are not included here. Respondents may report more than one energy insecurity issue.
c Includes inability to use main heating equipment at any time during the previous 12 months because equipment was broken and household could not have it repaired or because of an electricity, natural gas, or bulk fuel disruption due to lack of payment.
d Includes inability to use air-conditoning equipment at any time during the previous 12 months because equipment was broken and household could not have it repaired or because of an electricity disruption due to lack of payment.
e Housing units are classified using criteria created by the U.S. Census Bureau based on 2010 Census data. Urbanized areas are densely settled groupings of blocks or tracts with 50,000 or more people, while urban clusters have at least 2,500 but less than 50,000 people. All other areas are rural.
f The Building America program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), created these climate regions. We combined climate regions for this publication. The Subarctic region is included with data for Very-cold/Cold. 
g Some other fuel includes coal and district steam.
h These characteristics refer to the householder that completed the RECS questionnaire.  
i Householders could select more than one racial category to describe themselves. These householders are only included as more than one race.
